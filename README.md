# MasterKitchen
This repository is the result of a project in the Department of Applied Informatics of the University of Macedonia, in Thessaloniki, Greece. This project was developed in 2021 throughout the "Software Engineering" course and it is the work of students during the semester.

This app takes account of all the vegetables,  spices and other eating material in your pantry  or refrigerator and then based on that suggests  you what you can make at home. It also gives you instructions  as to how to cook a specific recipe.

## Technologies-Prerequisites
This project was written in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and SQL.
In order to execute, it requires a web server or local testing software like xampp or wamp.

## Getting Started
ο φάκελος Recipe App with Api είναι μόνο με html/css/JavaScript οπότε τρέχει χωρίς localhost server.
